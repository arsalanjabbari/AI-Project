## Introduction
Diabetes is a prevalent and chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and accurate prediction of diabetes can significantly improve patient outcomes and guide proactive healthcare interventions. In this project, we utilize logistic regression, a powerful machine learning algorithm, to develop a predictive model for diabetes.

Logistic regression is a binary classification technique used to predict one of two possible outcomes. For diabetes prediction, we train the model on a dataset containing patient attributes such as age, BMI, blood pressure, and glucose levels. These attributes serve as input features, and the model learns to differentiate between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals based on these characteristics.

## Project Overview
### Phase One: Data Preparation
In this phase, the focus is on preparing the data required for training and evaluating the logistic regression model for diabetes prediction. You can obtain the necessary data from a reliable source and ensure it is in a suitable format for training.

### Phase Two: Training a Logistic Regression Model for Diabetes Prediction
The objective of this phase is to train a logistic regression model using the prepared data. The key steps include:
1. **Data Splitting**: Divide the dataset into training and validation sets.
2. **Model Training**: Apply the logistic regression algorithm to the training data to estimate feature coefficients.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the trained model's performance using validation data.

### Phase Three: Developing a User Interface for Diabetes Prediction
In this phase, a user interface is developed to allow users to input their features, and the model predicts whether they are diabetic or not.

### The project repository has the following structure:

- **main.py**: The main Python script that contains the implementation of the logistic regression algorithm, model training, and user interface development.
- **GUI.py/**: A file containing codes and functions related to the user interface development.
- **Data/**: A directory containing sample datasets for diabetes prediction.

## Features
- **Full Implementation of Logistic Regression**: The logistic regression algorithm is implemented from scratch, providing a comprehensive understanding of its principles and control over the training process.
- **User-Friendly Application**: A user interface is created to make the prediction process simple and intuitive.
- **Customizable Model Training**: Users can train the model on their dataset by providing properly formatted CSV files with attributes and labels.

## Getting Started
