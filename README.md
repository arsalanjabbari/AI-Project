# Diabetes Prediction

The Diabetes Predictor Desktop Application is a user-friendly tool that utilizes a logistic regression model to predict the probability of a user having diabetes based on their inputted information. The application features a custom implementation of the logistic regression algorithm, an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI), and the ability to train the model on custom datasets. It aims to aid in early detection and proactive healthcare interventions for diabetes management.

## Introduction
Diabetes is a prevalent and chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and accurate prediction of diabetes can significantly improve patient outcomes and guide proactive healthcare interventions. In this project, we aim to utilize logistic regression, a popular machine learning algorithm, to develop a predictive model for diabetes.

Logistic regression is a powerful tool for binary classification problems, where the objective is to predict one of two possible outcomes. In the case of diabetes prediction, we will train our logistic regression model on a dataset containing various patient attributes such as age, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, and glucose levels, among others. These attributes will serve as input features, and our model will learn to distinguish between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals based on these characteristics.

## Features
- Logistic regression-based diabetes prediction.
- User-friendly desktop application with an intuitive graphical user interface.
- Ability to train the model on custom datasets, allowing flexibility and adaptation to specific use cases.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- `data/`: Contains sample datasets for training and testing the model.
- `diabetes_predictor/`: Contains the source code for the Diabetes Predictor application.
- `docs/`: Documentation files, including the README and other relevant information.
- `models/`: Pretrained models and model evaluation files.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python packages for setting up the environment.

## Requirements
Before using the Diabetes Predictor application, ensure you have the following:
- Python 3.x
- Required packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## Usage Guide
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `diabetes_predictor/` directory.
3. Install the required packages by running: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Launch the application by running: `python main.py`
5. Input the necessary patient attributes when prompted through the GUI.
6. The application will display the predicted probability of diabetes based on the given inputs.

Feel free to explore the repository, modify the source code, and train the model with your datasets for specific use cases. For more details on how to use and contribute to the Diabetes Predictor, please refer to the documentation in the `docs/` directory.

Remember that this application is not intended to replace medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always consult a healthcare professional for diabetes-related concerns and diagnosis.
